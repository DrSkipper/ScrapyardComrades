notes from playtest:
- hard
- need to add controls graffiti/posters
- need more time for players to warm up to controls without having to make perfect jumps/wall jumps to get places
- more automove on wall jump?
- slower wall slide? add wall slide acceleration?
- jump grace and buffer for wall jumps?
- more enemy attack cooldown?
- less enemy damage?
- need better indication of health loss due to attrition
- one person asked if they could play from a checkpoint
- one person said the movement reminded them of Teslagrad

- like art and music
- like sliding and slide-jump
- people like trying to find out how to get to more difficult to access areas, rather than just take the easier path, even if they have to spend a lot of time doing so (though could also be because health attrition wasn't clear enough)
