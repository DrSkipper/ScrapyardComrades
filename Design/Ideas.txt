Ideas:

Might be good to programatically set camera orthographic size to 1/2 window height, unless below certain amount (480?) then set to full height.

Heart healing: possibly have an enemy's heart heal a portion (close to 100%?) of damage that enemy dealt to the player, plus a constant. Maybe that constant scales inversely with amount of health player currently has? Maybe "high level" mutated players take less damage from enemies?


npc gifts:
 - passive permanent ability to continually reduce friction & air friction longer player can maintain speed above a baseline
 - single pickup throwable, when thrown user teleports to first collision it makes (then can pick it back up again to use again)

lore:
 - tanks holding mutants are same style as checkpoints
 - ambulances like the one crashed at the beginning are seen at the power plant and hearts are being unloaded from them
