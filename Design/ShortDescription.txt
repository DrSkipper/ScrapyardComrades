In a city where citizens must feast on the hearts of others in order to advance, will you do your best to resist the system while trying to survive, or embrace society's foundation on violence and seek success?

Feeble Force leverages speedrunning and game-breaking mechanics to tell its story about a city that's dying. In a city where inhabitants must feast on the hearts of others in order to advance, will you do your best to resist the system while trying to survive, or embrace society's foundation on violence and seek success?

For pitching:

Mostly looking for artists who can get on board politically, even if the game itself is weird and vague and doesn't explicitly present a political perspective, I'd like to work with a team that understands and is down with what's happening under the surface. This pretty much just means I'm looking for people who have a personal interest in exploring the game's metaphor for this current era in which the contradictions of capitalism are being stretched to their limits.
