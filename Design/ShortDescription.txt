In a city where citizens must feast on the hearts of others in order to advance, will you do your best to resist the system while trying to survive, or embrace society's foundation on violence and seek success?

Feeble Force leverages speedrunning and game-breaking mechanics to tell its story about a city that's dying.

longer second part:

Feeble Force is mechanically built around speedrunning and game-breaking mechanics which it leverages to tell its story about the city it takes place in. The inhabitants of this city are always dying, and the only way for them to recover health is to consume the heart of another human. However, as people consume more hearts they begin to lose their humanity and mutate into something else.

Feeble Force attempts a design that is conscious of the game-breaking techniques utilized by many speedrunners, designing levels that to some extent are meant to be broken. Environmental puzzle mechanics often have an effect on player movement attributes such as gravity, friction, and speed, allowing players to approach puzzles in a clever and experimental manner to boost themselves into unexpected areas. Some game states and systemic assumptions can also be exploited to allow for additional game-breaking.

The game functions as a sort of 1-directional metroidvania: as the player mutates, some pathways in the city will open up while others become inaccessible. Players will be led on different paths depending on how they play and will likely have to play through the game multiple times in different ways to uncover the full story of what is happening in the city.

-----

There are multiple endings which involve the participation of the player in different ways depending on how they played their way through the game, meaning players have to play through the game multiple times to get the full story of the city and to witness the final events of the game from all perspectives.

It is completely possible to beat the game without utilizing these techniques, but players who are willing to experiment in game-breaking will be able to access parts of the city that their character is not intended to reach, and can even upset the system that the city and the game itself operates under, reaching unintended end states for their character.


For pitching:

Mostly looking for artists who can get on board politically, even if the game itself is weird and vague and doesn't explicitly present a political perspective, I'd like to work with a team that understands and is down with what's happening under the surface. This pretty much just means I'm looking for people who have a personal interest in exploring the game's metaphor for this current era in which the contradictions of capitalism are being stretched to their limits.
