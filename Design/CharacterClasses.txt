Character classes:

Support - Can leave behind/send out orbs which slow to a stop and hover in place for a while, either cause damage or trap enemy, can also be used for other abilities.
Can dodge attacks?

Ranger - Fires ranged shots, can create cover which can be shot through and moved through from one side (disappears + gives speed boost when moved through from that side?). Can dash to cross distances at faster speed.

Smasher - Melee attacks, can pound ground to create shockwave that stuns, can throw enemies (or friendlies), can block/counter attacks (?)


Chests or other sorts of pickup locations can spawn in pre-placed positions on a map, forshadowed good deal in advance of spawn, allow character to pick up a choice of upgrade (with each character having simple, short upgrade tree)?


Basic idea for Support and Ranger upgrade trees:

             Base
            /    \
		Make     Improve
		Better   Team/Range
		1v1      Ability
		/    \    /    \
	Better   Useful	   Best team
	1v1     In both    Ability
	Again   (dep. on map)
    ^
   one or both of left side upgrades are probably melee attacks/power

Basic idea for Smasher upgrade tree:

             Base
			   |
		Make       Dodging
		More   -   Stuns
		Agile      
			   |
		Make       Dodging       Ranged
		More   -   Stuns     -   Attack? 
		Agile      
		(doesn't show what have already gotten)
