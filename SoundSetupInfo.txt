FOR ANIMATION SFX: (attack anims, jump anims, slide anims, door open anims, etc)
1) In the Project window, find the Assets/ScrapyardComrades/CustomObjects/Animations folder (it should be located near the top if external package folders are collapsed). Expand the folder
2) Expand the sub folder for the entity whose animations you want to edit
3) Click on the specific animation file for the animation you want to edit
4) Set the "Sfx" and "Sfx frame" fields in the inspector window

FOR HIT IMPACT SFX:
1) In the Project window, find the Assets/ScrapyardComrades/CustomObjects/Attacks folder (it should be located near the top if external package folders are collapsed, but after Animations). Expand the folder
2) Expand the sub folder for the entity whose animations you want to edit
3) Click on the specific attack data file for the attack you want to edit
4) Find the "Hit Parameters" field in the inspector window and expand it
5) Look for the "Hit Sfx" sub field, and enter the name of the SFX file you want to use

FOR SOME OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SFX:
- Some other SFX fields can sometimes be found directly on the Prefabs for the objects that use them.
1) In the Project window, find the Assets/ScrapyardComrades/Prefabs folder (probably somewhere in the middle of the project window scroll wheel). Expand that folder
2) Look for the prefab of the object you think might have a property for the SFX you want to change. Gameplay objects are kept in the Gameplay/Objects subfolder.
3) Click on the Prefab for the object you're looking for
4) In the inspector window scroll through the scripts on the object and look for SFX fields that are likely to correspond to the sound you're trying to change.
